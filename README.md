This site is built with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), which is written in Ruby, and makes use of Markdown (for content creation), YAML (for configuration and data), and Liquid (for templates).

## Notes for contributors:

- You'll need to have Jekyll installed on your local machine to contribute to this site. A great place to learn about Jekyll is our Udemy course, [Using Jekyll And GitHub Pages To Create Websites](https://www.udemy.com/jekyll-and-github-pages/?couponCode=aincwebsite) 
- The `_site` folder gets regenerated on Jekyll builds. Do not manipulate it directly.
- If you'd like to edit Course Content, it lives in the YAML files in `_data`. Be sure to properly escape all non-printable characters per the [YAML spec](http://www.yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html#id2776092).
- This site currently makes use of Jekyll Plugins, which are not compatible with GitHub Pages. While the repository is hosted on GitHub, the site is served from [DreamHost](http://dreamhost.com).
- When making small content changes and bugfixes, it's acceptable to commit to Master. For all larger changesets, please create a new branch and merge when ready.
